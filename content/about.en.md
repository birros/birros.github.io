## Editorial line

Being natively French-speaking, the pages are first written in French before
being translated by me in English.

This site serves as a showcase for __my creations__ as well as __my favorites__
concerning *projects*, *ideas*, *wishes*, *methods*, *tips*, *tutorials*,
*tools*, *objects*, *people*, *organizations*...

Wishing to be __constructive__, each page is written with a set of principles in
mind : *concision*, *precision*, *clarity*, *pedagogy*.

## Contributions

Don't hesitate to [open a ticket] or [propose changes] if a misprint or an
omission occurs into a page. If the use of a version control system is unknown
to you please contact me directly.

## Technology

All pages on this site are produced using the [Hugo] static site generator and
the [Ananke] theme. The sources and the site are hosted on [GitHub].

## Author

Amateur of sciences with a strong preference for mathematics, computer science
and physics, my curiosity also wanders on the side of philosophy, economics
and politics. Free thinker by conviction, no taboo or obscurantism frightens me.
