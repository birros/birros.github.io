## Editorial line

Being natively French-speaking the pages are written in French, English
translation is possible if I find it useful or if a request exists.

This site serves as a showcase for __my creations__ as well as __my favorites__
concerning *projects*, *ideas*, *wishes*, *methods*, *tips*, *tutorials*,
*tools*, *objects*, *people*, *organizations*...

Wishing to be __constructive__, each page is written with a set of principles in
mind : *concision*, *precision*, *clarity*, *pedagogy*.

## Author

Amateur of sciences with a strong preference for mathematics, computer science
and physics, my curiosity also wanders on the side of philosophy, economics
and politics. Free thinker by conviction, no taboo or obscurantism frightens me.
